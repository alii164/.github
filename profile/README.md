# zkPass

zkPass is a composable and privacy-preserving identity protocol based on Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technologies. It allows users to selectively disclose verifiable data, such as legal identities, financial information, social interactions, educational backgrounds, healthcare records, personal experiences, and skills, to third parties without revealing or uploading any detailed documents. zkPass emphasizes privacy preservation, security, trustworthiness, and compatibility with various data sources in the digital landscape.

zkPass seamlessly integrates into any HTTPS websites and on-chain data sources through a TLS-based Oracle. By leveraging cutting-edge privacy computing techniques and ensuring data integrity and validity with various identity sources, zkPass provides a comprehensive solution for identity verification across Web2 and Web3. It aims to be a robust infrastructure for decentralized society.
